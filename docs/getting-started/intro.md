# Getting started

Buckle up and get going with **iRacing Web SDK in under 5 minutes**.

## What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:

  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

- A Package Manager

  - Either works
    - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) verion 9.0 or above
      - More straightforward and widely used, but can lead to duplicate files and higher disk usage.
    - [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) version 9.0 or above
      - More efficient in regards to disk space and also faster due to unique handling of dependencies. Better for larger projects or when disk space is an issue.

- Active iRacing Membership
  - Unfortunately, without an active iRacing subscription, this SDK will not work as of May 2024. This is not my doing, this is due to the nature of how the iRacing team handles their API.
  - A test dev account **has not** been confirmed or mentioned in the forums. But perhaps at the time you're reading this, this has changed.
  - For more information or questions, visit the [forums](https://forums.iracing.com/) (an active account is required to view them).

## Account Registration

If you would like to sign up for an account to be able to use the iRacing services and API, visit the [iRacing](https://www.iracing.com/) website and follow the directions on becoming a member.
